### q1)*Let's write the stages of the given array according to the sort type.* <br/>
[22,27,16,2,18,6] <br/>
*smallest unit of array 2. in that case 2 and 22 swap places.;* <br/>
[2,27,16,22,18,6] then ;<br/>
[2,6,16,22,18,27] and; <br/>
[2,6,16,18,22,27] 
### q2)*Let's write the Big-O notation.* <br/>
(Big-O notation for worst case) : o(n^2) <br/>
(Big-O notation for best case) : o(n) <br/>
### q3)*Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle.* <br/>
###  *Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end.* <br/>
###  *Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the array.* <br/>
After the array is sorted, the middle number becomes 18. *So 18 is the avaerage case*.
### *[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] the first four steps of the series:* <br/>
1. [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
2. [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
3. [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
4. [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
